Welcome to OSODY STUDIOS, where creativity meets technology! Our project is designed to empower users with a seamless experience for managing content and bringing their digital visions to life.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started with OSODY STUDIOS, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js set up, follow these steps to install the project dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm i         # Install project dependencies
npm run dev   # Run the development server
```

# Setting Up MongoDB üóÑÔ∏è

Before you can use all the features of OSODY STUDIOS, you'll need to set up a MongoDB account and create a database. Follow these steps to get your database ready:

1. Sign up or log in to your MongoDB account.
2. Create a new database named osodyStudiosDB.
3. Within this database, create the collections as specified in the db.ts file. Note that the collection names are placeholders and can be customized to suit your needs.
4. Remember to add your MongoDB credentials to a .env file in the root of the project directory. The .env file should include your database connection string, like so:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
```

Once you've completed the installation and set up your MongoDB database, you're ready to use OSODY STUDIOS. Navigate through the project using the development server you've started with npm run dev. This will allow you to explore the functionalities of our CMS, update content dynamically, and fully experience the capabilities of OSODY STUDIOS.
